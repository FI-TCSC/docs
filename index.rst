TCSC Narvi cluster's new user documentation!
======================================

Narvi is the `Tampere University's <https://www.tuni.fi>`_ HPC linux cluster.  It serves all
researchers of University. It is almost identical to other `FGCI <https://www.csc.fi/en/-/suomen-grid-ja-pilvilaskentainfrastruktuuri-hankkii-dell-emc-n-palvelimia>`_ clusters.
Also we are very similar than large CSC clusters, but of course they are larger
and Narvi might easier to start with because it is more integrated into the local
environment.

Current documentation is still on `eDuuni <https://wiki.eduuni.fi/display/tuttcsc/TCSC+Home>`_ 

If you are here for `FGCI kickstart <Kickstart_>`_ link to local differences is `here <kickstart-diffs.html>`_
